# Music

### Battle Cry of Freedom
Two arrangments of the song from the American Civil War, the Battle Cry of Freedom for viola and 2 cellos
Strongly inspired by the mournful piano arrangment feature in Ken Burns' *The Civil War* documentary series

### Hard Times Come Again No More
The song "Hard Tiems Come Again No More" arranged for solo viola in the keys of G and C major

## Note on readability
With a few exceptions, this music has been arranged with the intent of being played by a computer syntesizer, and while some effort has been put into making things readable, the music may not be nicely formatted for human players or even playable. In general, arrangments for string instruments are in the appropate range, but may include immpossible to play note combinations such as three or four simultanious notes. Of course, that's no reason not to try it anyway.
